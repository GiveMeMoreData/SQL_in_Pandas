#  <span style="color:#1893F8">Implementing SQL queries using Pandas</span>
I really hope you don't mind that all my commentary is in English. :) 


## <span style="color:#1893F8">Project description</span>
The aim of the project is to implement 7 given SQL queries in Python using Pandas.  
Each query has a short description of what it's doing and details about my approach in doing the same in 
Pandas.   
The resoult is accepted when SQL and Pandas give the same data with eventual difference in permutation of rows.
  
In every query, as first I present SQL code that I received and right after it there is my approach of doing the same but in Pandas.
